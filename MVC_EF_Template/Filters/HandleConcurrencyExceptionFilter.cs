/// This attribute attempts to intercept DbUpdateConcurrencyException to write out original/new values
/// to the screen for the user to review.
/// It assumes the following:
/// 1. There is a [Timestamp] attribute on an entity framework model property
/// 2. The only differences that we care about from the posted data to the record currently in the database are 
/// only the model state field. We do not have access to a model at this point, as an exception was raised so there was no
/// return View(model) that we have a model to process from.
/// As such, we have to look at the fields in the modelstate and try to find matching fields on the entity and then display the differences.

/// This may not work in all cases of view models, etc. Test in your enviroment
/// Ensure you add this action filter in /App_Start/FilterConfig.cs
/// Also note that if you come across an exception in your controller from concurrency
/// the method execution will end. If you load data after that point that your controller requires
/// then you will need to ensure you catch that exception, load your data, and then throw; to continue
/// bubbling up to action filter (not throw ex as that rethrows a new exception)

/// This class will look at your model to get the property names. It will then check your
/// Entities current values vs. db values for these property names.
